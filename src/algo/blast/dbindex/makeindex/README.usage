ABSTRACT

    makembindex is the utility that can index a set of nucleotide
    sequences. It takes, as input, a FASTA formatted file or a BLAST
    database, and creates a specially formatted set of files that index
    the locations of N-mer occurrences in the database for a given 
    value of N. In addition, the compressed sequence data is also stored
    in the index files. However, ambiguity characters are not preserved.

    The indexed databases created by makembindex are currently used
    by production MegaBLAST software and by a new srsearch utility 
    designed to quickly search for nearly exact matches (up to one mismatch)
    of short queries against a genomic database.

    When a FASTA formatted file is used as the input, then masking
    by lower case letters is incorporated in the index. The searches against
    an index containing masking information will not produce results
    The index structure is described in [1]. Please cite this paper in any
    publication that uses makembindex.

SYNOPSIS

    makembindex [-h] [-help] [-input input_file_name] -output index_name
    [-iformat input_format] [-legacy use_legacy_index_format] [-nmer nmer_size] 
    [-ws_hint word_size_hint] [-volsize volume_size] [-stride stride] 

OPTIONS

    -h

        Print a short usage information and exit.

    -help

        Print a comprehensive usage information and exit.

    -old_style_index [true/false]

        Default: true

        If set to 'false' the new style index is created. New style
        indices should have -iformat blastdb specified and are only
        used for creating indices from BLAST databases. Option
        -output is ignored when creating a new style index. New style
        indices are always created at the same location as the 
        corresponding BLAST database.

    -input input_file_name

        default: stdin

        Input file name or BLAST database name depending on the input 
        format used.  For FASTA formatted input this parameter is 
        optional and defaults to the program's standard input stream.

    -output index_name

        The resulting index name. The index itself can consist of
        multiple files, called volumes, called <index_name>.00.idx,
        <index_name>.01.idx,...

        This options should not be used with new style indices.

    -iformat input_format

        default: fasta

        The input format selector. Possible values are 'fasta' and 
        'blastdb'.

    -legacy use_legacy_index_format

        default: true

        Possible values of this parameter are 'true' or 'false'. If the
        value is true then the values of -stride, -nmer, and -ws_hint
        are ignored, and the result is produced using an older 
        index format. This is a compatibility feature to support
        current production MegaBLAST. The legacy format functionally
        corresponds to setting "-stride 5 -nmer 12 -ws_hint 28".

    -nmer nmer_size

        default: 12

        N-mer size to use. This parameter is ignored if -legacy true is
        specified.

    -ws_hint word_size_hint

        default: 28

        This is an optimization hint for makembindex that indicates an
        expected minimum match size in searches that use the index. If
        n is the value of -nmer parameter and s is the value of -stride
        parameter, then the value of -ws_hint must be at least n + s - 1.

    -stride stride

        default: 5

        makembindex will index every stride-th N-mer of the database.

    -volsize volume_size

        default: 1536

        The target index volume size in megabytes.

EXAMPLES

    To create an index from a FASTA formatted input file named 'input.fa',
    for use with production MegaBLAST:

    makembindex -input input.fa -output db_index

    To create an index from a FASTA formatted input file named 'input.fa'
    using N-mer size 11 for use with srsearch utility:

    makembindex -input input.fa -output db_index -legacy false -nmer 11 -stride 1 -ws_hint 11
