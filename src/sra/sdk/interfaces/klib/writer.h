/* ----------
 * The writer module (which contains the log, status, out, and debug sub-modules)
 * is an ecapsulation and virtualization of standard output.
 *
 *  this logging API - like most others - attempts to remain isolated
 *  from any actual logging implementation, such that output may be
 *  routed in several ways.
 *
 *  the default handler
 *
 *  the path from unstructured text to formatted XML is difficult in that
 *  it requires parsing, and is therefore error prone.
 *
 *  the path from structured reports to XML as well as less or unstructured
 *  text is simple to implement, but generally more of a burden to use.
 *
 *  the challenge is therefore to present an API that makes structured
 *  logging less painful than it might be.
 *
 *
 * There are two parts with an unfortunate legacy quirky combination.
 *  There is a formater that will be shared by all sub-modules.
 *  There is the actual stream writer.
 *
 * Each submodule will have one or more calls that call the formatter and writer functions.
