Usage:
  nencvalid [options] <file-path> [ <file-path> ...]

Summary:
  Validate the consistency of NCBI format encrypted files

Parameters:
  file-path                        A file in an NCBI encrypted file format.
                                   The first version encrypted file format
                                   needs a password to validate the content
                                   while the second version does not.  If the
                                   ncbi-file uri format is used if you ask
                                   file decryption (encrypt in the query)
                                   the validation will be on the decrypted
                                   file which might not be the intention.
                                   The password if needed for validation will
                                   have to be in the standard NCBI VDB
                                   configuration as 'krypto/pwfile' or 
                                   referenced by the environment variable
                                   VDB_PWFILE or Config parameter

Options:
  -q|--quiet                       no text output overriding log and status
