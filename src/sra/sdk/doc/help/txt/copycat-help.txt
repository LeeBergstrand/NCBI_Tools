copycat : 1.0.6

Usage: 
    copycat [ <options> ] src-file dst-file
    copycat [ <options> ] src-file [src-file...] dst-dir
    copycat [ <options> ] -o dst-dir src-file [src-file...]

    options:
      -x cache-dir         location to output cached files
      -f                   force overwrite of existing files
      -m magicfile         path to the magic file to use
      -e extfile           path to the extensions file to use
      -c classfile         path to the file class/type file

    behavior is intended to mimic 'cp' to a large extent, in that
    a single source file may be copied to a new name, or multiple
    source files may be copied to a destination directory.

    when the destination directory is specified using 'cp' semantics,
    the directory must exist. if specified via '-o' switch, it will be
    created if necessary.

    the target file may also be a device. in the special case of
    /dev/null, it may also act as a directory.

    the '-x' option allows small files that are typed as eligible for
    caching to be copied to the cache directory provided. the directory
    will be created if necessary.
    the intent is to capture top-level files, such that files are copied
    into the flat cache directory without regard to where they were found
    in the input hierarchy. in the case of name conflict, output files will
    be renamed.

    the class file, magic file and extension file allow new understandings
    of files found while cataloging
    the magic file is of the type used by the unix/linux 'file' command
    the class file assigns file type to classes
    the extension file assigns file extensions to file types

    existing classes are 'Archive', 'Cached', 'Compressed', 'Read'
    Archive and Compresses files are those that have contents that can
    be examined - new types must be compiled in
    Cached files are those affected by the -x option
    Read files are not handled seperately by copy cat except in the catalog
    new classes would like Read only be added to the catalog with the class

    the format for the class file is lines such as the below
        'GnuZip<tab>Compressed<lf>' with tabs and linefeeds

    the format for the extension file is lines such as the below
        'gz<tab>Compressed<lf>' with tabs and linefeeds
