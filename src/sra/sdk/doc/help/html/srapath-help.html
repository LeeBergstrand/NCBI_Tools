Usage:
 srapath 1.2.0

Usage: srapath [ options ] accession ...

    options:
      --server <repserver-path>       path(s) to replication server(s)
      --volume <volume-path>          relative path(s) to volume(s)

    Tool to produce a list of full paths to SRA runs from list of
    accessions.  Output paths are ordered according to accession list.
    with no path alteration options, the accession search path will be
    determined according to the local installation.
    Replication server and volume paths may be compound, adhering to the
    Unix path convention of ':' separators, e.g.

        '/server1:/server2/subdir'

    The idea behind separate replication servers and volumes is to
    allow for a matrix of volumes that can hold a run, where the volumes
    are expected to be replicated across all repservers.  It is possible that
    this arrangement will be violated and still work, but behavior is less
    clearly defined.

    The order of search paths is important: rather than alphabetical,
    specify paths in the preferred order of discovery, usually giving the most
    recently updated volumes first.  If a run appears more than once in the matrix,
    it will be found according to the first 'repserver/volume' combination that
    produces a hit.

    Finally, this tool produces a path that is 'likely' to be a run, in that
    an entry exists in the file system at the location predicted.  It is possible
    that this path will fail to produce success upon opening a run if the path does
    not point to a valid object.
