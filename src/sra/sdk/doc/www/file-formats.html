					<h3>Database file formats</h3>
					The contents of the SRA archives are not suitable for off the shelf database management systems
					due to the large size of archives.  Compression of the contents was critical to cost effectively
					keeping the database on-line with fast retrieval.
					<br/>
					To increase compression a column major format of the data was used rather than a more common
					row major format where all the contents of a row's tuple are kept together.  Like types compress
					better than unlike types due to a better predictabilty of the content. Duplicate rows on contiguous
					columns are commpon and can be comressed with a run length encoding and being like types further
					compression can be more effective by predicting the range and volitilty of the data within the
					column.
					<br/>
					The native file system of the target platform is used also unlike a DBMS which manages all the space
					within a large file or even an entire disk volume.  This gains us in efficieny of development and
					run time where only those file which need to be opened are opened and multiple processes acting on
					separate database objects do not have to co-ordinate reads and writes.
					
					<h4>Columns</h4>
					A column is kept in its own directory along with any supporting files needed such as various index files.
					<h4>Tables</h4>
					A table is a collection of related columns.  It is also kept in it's own directory. A row is made up of an entry from each column to make
					an N-tuple. Most older DNA file formats are stored within the SRA system as a table.
					<h4>Databases</h4>
					In the SRA tool kit a database is typically a set of tables though it can contain additional columns(?) 
					or other databases. Again it is kept in its own directory.
					
					<h4>Archive file</h4>
					The SRA Toolkit's native file format is a single file archive that contains the files and directories needed
					for the database object as described above.
					<br/>
					Superficially the format resembles the older tar file format or zip compressed archive but with differences
					to allow efficient processing without extraction.  UNlike a tar file the directory information for the whole
					file is kept together so it can be read and processed at one time rather than scanning the whole file to
					find directory information spread throughout the file. UNlike a zip file the individual columns are already
					compressed and the archive does not attempt a futile effort to compress them further.
			
					<h5>SRA</h5>
					An SRA file is a single file table in an archive format.

					<h5>cSRA</h5>
					A cSRA file is a single file database with several expected tables in an archive format.

					<h3>Encrypted file formats</h3>

					Currently the SRA Toolkit utilities only use encryption in two file formats defined by NCBI.  In the future it is expected 
					to be used in more ways as the need arises.
			
					<br/>
			
					To meet Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) the SRA Toolkit uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for 
					the actual encryption of data.
			
					<h4>Early Encryption Format - ncbi_enc</h4>
			
					The first encryption format supported by the SRA Toolkit typically uses the extension ".ncbi_enc".  It was used to encrypt
					files that were being sent to computers not on the NCBI network.  It is now a deprecated format because a new requirement
					in file validation could not be supported. The SRA Toolkit fully supports reading and decrypting this format but
					no longer encrypts into this format.
			
					<h4>Current Encryption Format - nenc</h4>
			
					The current NCBI encryption format was designed for efficient processing without explicitly decrypting a file to the
					disk and to allow content validation without needing the password used to encrypt the file.

					<h4>Password File</h4>

					The toolkit starts with the belief that passwords put on command lines have an inherent security risk 
					in that command line parameters can be seen by other users of a computer through Unix commands like 'ps'.
					To answer that weakness the SRA Toolkit uses passwords read from secure files or the environment.  The preference
					being password files.
					<br/>
					The SRA Toolkit uses its <a href=configuration.html>configuration</a> to locate the password via an
					entry named 'krypto/pwfile'.
					<br/>
					The contents of an encryption password file is normally some sort of text, but that is not a strict requirement.
					The password is up to 4096 bytes, which with UTF-8 or other encodings might be fewer characters.  The only characters 
					that can not be in this are the Carriage Return (CR) or Line Feed (LF) also called Newline ASCII control bytes.  The cryptographic library
					will use the first part of the file up to the CR or LF.  If the file is longer that 4096 bytes and does not have a CR or LF nefre the 4097th 
					byte the library will call the file invalid.
					<br/>
					Bytes after the first CR or LF are reserved for future use; perhaps as previously used passwords.

			<h2>Extraction data formats</h2>
			The NCBI does not encourage always extracting the data from the archive as our archive formats are compact
			and easy to use.  But if other formats are needed for specific uses the data can be extracted in full or 
			part to other formats.  These formats have many variations and options to the extraction programs
			allow for spcific forms of the formats.

				<li>sff</li>
				<li>bam/sam</li>

			<h2>Input formats?</h2>
			Are we documenting loaders yet?
