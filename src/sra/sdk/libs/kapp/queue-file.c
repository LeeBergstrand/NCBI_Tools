/* MakeRead
 *  make a queue file for reading-ahead on background thread
 *
 *  when the file is created, a background thread is started
 *  that begins reading from "src" at position "pos", into
 *  buffers of size "buffer_size". each buffer is pushed into
 *  a cross-thread queue where it is consumed by the reading
 *  thread.
 *
 *  the background thread is throttled by queue capacity - determined
 *  by "queue_bytes" and "block_size", such that if the queue is full,
 *  the thread will sleep. the consumer thread is also throttled by the
 *  queue in that it will sleep if the queue is empty with pending data.
 *
 *  the background thread will exit upon reaching end of file,
 *  upon a permanent error, or if the queue is sealed by the consumer
 *  thread.
 *
 *  when the file is collected in response to a release message,
 *  the queue will be sealed against further inserts, pending buffers
 *  will be discarded, the background thread will be joined, and
 *  the source file will be released.
 *
 *  the intended usage is serial reading of the file. reads
 *  may only progress forward, i.e. backing up is not permitted.
 *
 *  "qf" [ OUT ] - return parameter for queue file
 *
 *  "pos" [ IN ] - starting position for reads from "src".
 *  NB - "src" must support being addressed at this position.
 *
 *  "src" [ IN ] - source file for read-ahead on background thread.
 *  must have read permissions.
 *
 *  "queue_bytes" [ IN ] - the read-ahead limit of the background
 *  thread, in bytes. this is the amount of data that will be queued
 *  for the consumer thread before the bg thread sleeps.
 *
 *  "block_size" [ IN, DEFAULT ZERO ] - optional parameter giving
 *  desired block size when reading from "src". this may be used
 *  to tune reading for source data, e.g. 64K blocks for gzip.
