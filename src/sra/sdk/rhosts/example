# An example remote build server definitions file
# 
# Curently, only Windows build servers are supported, with linux as a client.
#
# This file should be prepared wor each remote server you intend to use and placed in $TOP/rhosts/
#
# To activate a remote build with this server:
# On a Windows build server:
# - for each source tree that is to be built by this server, map a Windows drive to its source directory, or any directory above it
#   (you can service many source locations via one mapped drive)
# - open a Cygwin session, set it up to use the 64- or 32- bit MS build tools, as needed
# - start an instance of proxy-srv.exe (located in the VDB bin directory; if not, build one using make -C test/proxy-srv)
# On the Linux client:
# - run 'make <this file's name>' from the source root directory
# - run 'make' as usual - this should now send build jobs to the server. The output files will be created under win/<linkage>/vc++/<arch>/
#
# To switch back to local builds, run 'make local' from the source root directory
#
# This file will be included into a Makefile.
# For running a build remotely, the following variables should be defined :

# there should be an instance of proxy-srv running on this server, listening on the default port:
RHOST = ncbipcXXXX

# the only one supported for now:
OS = win

# the only one supported for now:
COMP = vc++

# x86_64 or i386; make sure proxy-srv is running in an environment using matching (64- or 32-bit) MS build tools:
ARCH = x86_64

# Optionally, pick a location above the source tree of the build and set LHOME to it. If LHOME not specified, it will be set to $HOME 
LHOME = /home/boshkina/internal

# map a Windows drive to LHOME and place it here:
RHOME = Z:
