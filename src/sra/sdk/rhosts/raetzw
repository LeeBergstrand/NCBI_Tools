# An example remote build server definitions file
# 
# Curently, only Windows build servers are supported, with linux as a client.
#
# This file should be prepared wor each remote server you intend to use and placed in $TOP/rhosts/
#
# To activate a remote build with this server:
# - open a Cygwin session, set it up to use the 64- or 32- bit MS build tools, as needed
# - start an instance of proxy-srv.exe (located in the VDB bin directory; if not, build one using make -C test/proxy-srv)
# - on the linux client, run 'make <this file's name>' from the source root directory
# - on the linux client, run 'make' as usual - this should now send build jobs to the server. The output files will be created under win/<linkage>/rvc++/x86_64/
#
# To switch back to local builds, run 'make local' from the source root directory
#
# This file will be included into a Makefile.
# For running a build remotely, all the following variables should be defined :
#

#this is the raetzw-pc
RHOST = ncbipc9160

#this is the boshkina-pc
#RHOST = ncbipc8123
RPORT = 20100
OS = win
COMP = vc++
ARCH = i386
RHOME = Z:
