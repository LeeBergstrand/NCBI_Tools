1. Requirements
---------------

In order to build xmlwrapp, you need libxml2 version 2.4.28 or newer. When
building with XSLT support, libxslt 1.1.6 or newer is required. Both libraries
are available from http://xmlsoft.org.


2. Building on Unix
-------------------

On Unix, the usual Autotools-based build system is used. Building xmlwrapp is
usually as simple as running the following three commands:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

See the output of `./configure --help` for additional settings and options.


3. Building on Windows
----------------------

At this time, only building with Visual C++ compiler is supported. The required
project files are located in platform/Win32 directory.


4. Using xmlwrapp
-----------------

On Unix, you should use pkg-config to get compiler flags for xmlwrapp or
xsltwrapp libraries:

   c++ -c `pkg-config --cflags xmlwrapp` ...
   c++ -o ... `pkg-config --libs xmlwrapp`

On Windows, you need to link against xmlwrapp libraries and add the include/
directory to compiler's headers search path.
