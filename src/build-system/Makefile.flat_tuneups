# Some projects cannot be built in parallel due to sharing object files.
# The build system's locking mechanism keeps attempts to do so from
# interfering with each other, but can introduce delays, so it would be
# best to avoid intra-build contention altogether.  However, make's
# limitations make that easier said than done; the only way to keep it from
# building a pair of targets in parallel is to claim that one depends on
# the other, which is effective but can result in overbuilding and
# potentially introduce bottlenecks in the case of suboptimal ordering.
# (GNU Make's concept of order-only prerequisites is not as useful as it
# sounds, as make still insists on updating those targets, just not on
# updating whatever lists them as OOPs unless it otherwise has cause to.)
#
# To address these issues, the build system takes a two-pronged approach.
# First, the script (scripts/common/impl/make_lock_map.sh) that produces
# the relevant .hints files attempts to sort targets in decreasing order of
# utility, as gauged by frequency as a prerequisite in Makefile.flat.  In
# addition, this makefile includes the hints only when building high-level
# targets corresponding to multiple leaf targets and their prerequisites,
# as a single application or library and its prerequisites should not
# normally have any object files in common.  Those heuristics are somewhat
# crude, but should keep intra-build contention to a minimum while still
# largely avoiding overbuilding and bottlenecks.
