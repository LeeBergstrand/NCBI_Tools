<h3><a name="edit"></a>Edit global style</h3>
<p>Edit the global drawing style that applies to all structures. (To change the 
  style of specific residues, see the <A href="#annotate">Annotate</A> item below.) 
  This brings up the style editor panel. You will see the changes take effect 
  immediately if the <b>Apply after each change</b> option is on; otherwise, changes 
  will only occur when you click <b>Apply</b> or <b>Done</b>. The settings chosen 
  here will be saved and restored automatically when you write your data out to 
  a file. There are three tabbed panes in the style editor:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Settings</b> tab: these items control rendering and coloring of the various 
    structural elements. The columns in this panel are: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Group</b>: which atoms or objects 
    are controlled by each row. 
      <li><b>Show</b>: whether these items should be displayed, and for backbones, 
        what type of backbone is drawn. <b>Trace</b> is alpha carbon or phosphate 
        only; <b>Partial</b> shows all backbone atoms that make a linear 
    chain. 
      <li><b>Rendering</b>: what shapes are used to draw these elements. See the 
        descriptions of <A href="#rendering_descr">rendering styles</A> below. 
      <li><b>Color scheme</b>: how these items are colored. See the descriptions 
        of <A href="#coloring_descr">coloring styles</A> below. 

      <li><b>User color</b>: press these buttons to select any color to use when 
        <b>Color scheme</b> is set to <b>User selection</b>. On PC and UNIX, the 
        background color of these buttons will be the color selected.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Labels</b> tab: controls if and how residues are labeled. 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Spacing</b>: labels are drawn every <b><i>N</i></b> residues. 
      <li><b>Type</b>: one or three letter 
    residue names are used. 
      <li><b>Numbering</b>: <b>Sequential</b> means residues are numbered in order 
        starting from one; <b>From PDB</b> will use residue 
    numbers from the original PDB file (which may be ordered arbitrarily). 
      <li><b>Contrast</b>: if selected, 
    white labels are used if the background is a dark color, and black labels 
    otherwise. 
      <li><b>Termini</b>: label the ends of 
    the chains. For example, the N terminal residue of chain B will be labeled 
    "N (B)". 
      <li><b>Metal ions</b>: whether to put the element symbol in the center of 
        transparently-drawn metal ions.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Details</b> tab: controls sizes of the various rendered objects. These 
    numbers are in units of Angstroms, except for <b>Space fill size</b> which 
    is a scale factor applied to the van der Waals radius of the element. For 
    example, you can change the relative radii of atoms and bonds in a Ball and 
    Stick model by adjusting the <b>Ball radius</b> and <b>Stick radius</b> items..</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="rendering_descr"></a>Rendering Styles</h4>
<p>Both the <A href="#edit">style editor</A> and the <A href="#rendering_short">rendering 
  shortcuts</A> offer a variety of drawing styles. Here are descriptions of the 
  available choices: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Wire worm</b>: a curved thin line 
  that is drawn through only the alpha carbons (or phosphates) of the backbone. 
  <li><b>Tube worm</b>: like <b>wire worm</b>, except a thick tube is drawn instead. 
  <li><b>Wire</b>: bonds between all atoms 
  are drawn as straight thin lines. 
  <li><b>Tube</b>: bonds between all atoms 
  are drawn as thick tubes. 
  <li><b>Ball and stick</b>: bonds are 
  drawn as thick tubes, and atoms are represented by spheres. 
  <li><b>Space fill</b> (sometimes called 
  CPK): atoms are drawn with larger spheres proportional to their van der Waals 
  radii. No bonds are drawn. 
  <li><b>With/without arrows</b>: this is a special style that applies only to 
    the objects that represent protein helices and strands, and controls whether 
    or not arrowheads are used to indicate the N-to-C direction of the protein 
    backbone. </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="coloring_descr"></a>Coloring Styles</h4>
<p>Both the <A href="#edit">style editor</A> and the <A href="#coloring_short">coloring 
  shortcuts</A> offer a variety of color schemes. Coloring schemes typically control 
  how atoms are colored; bonds are colored according to the colors of the atoms 
  at each end. Here are descriptions of the available choices: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Element</b>: colors by atomic 
  element. 
  <li><b>Object</b>: each structure object 
  - one MMDB/PDB entry - is assigned a different color. 
  <li><b>Molecule</b>: each molecule - one 
  chain or heterogen or solvent - is assigned a different color. 
  <li><b>Domain</b>: each domain in a 
  chain is assigned a different color. 
  <li><b>Secondary structure</b>: for 
  protein chains, distinguishes helix, strand, and coil with different colors. 
  <li><b>Temperature</b>: uses a 
  traditional temperature color cycle (blue - green - yellow - red - white) to 
  indicate relative temperature factors for each atom, where blue is lowest and 
  white highest temperature. 
  <li><b>Rainbow</b>: uses a ROYGBIV color 
  cycle along each chain from N to C (or 5' to 3'). 
  <li><b>Charge</b>: for proteins, draws 
  positively charged residues in blue, negative in red, and neutral in gray. 
  <li><b>Hydrophobicity</b>: for proteins, 
  uses a standard hydrophobicity scale to draw the most hydrophobic residues in 
  red, to the least hydrophobic (most hydrophilic) in blue. 
  <li><b>User selection</b>: a solid color 
  of the user's choice. 
  <li><b>Sequence conservation</b>: these schemes are all used to color sequence 
    alignments in different ways based on sequence conservation. 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Aligned</b>: aligned residues 
    are all red. 
      <li><b>Identity</b>: columns of 
    identical residues are red, others blue. 
      <li><b>Variety</b>: columns with the 
    lowest number of different amino acids represented are colored red, and 
    highest variety columns are blue. 
      <li><b>Weighted variety</b>: similar to <b>variety</b>, but scaled by a standard BLOSUM62 
    substitution score so that columns of most strongly conserved residues are 
    more red. 
      <li><b>Information content</b>: scales 
    color according to the information content of each column, where a higher 
    score is more red. 
      <li><b>Fit</b>: colors each residue according to how well it "fits" 
        in the column it is in (based on residue-to-PSSM score). A residue colored red has a high substitution 
        score given the other residues in that column; a blue color indicates a low score.</li>
      <li><b>Block fit</b>: similar to <i>fit</i> except residues are colored by blocks and ranked by the sum of residue-to-PSSM scores. The highest scoring blocks in the entire alignment are red, the lowest blue.</li>
      <li><b>Normalized block fit</b>: similar to <i>block fit</i> except scores are normalized within each column of aligned block; the highest scoring row in a given block column is red, the lowest blue.</li>
      <li><b>Block row fit</b>: Similar to <i>normalized block fit</i> excpet scores are normalized across each sequence row; the highest scoring block of a given sequence will be red, the lowest blue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="favorites"></a>Favorites</h3>
The <b>Favorites</b> submenu allows you to define your own rendering and coloring 
styles, which you can save for future sessions. To use this feature, simply define 
any (global) style using the above <A href="#edit">style editor</A>, then select 
<b>Add/Replace</b> and type in a name. A new menu item of that name will appear 
at the bottom of the <b>Favorites</b> submenu (or will replace an existing item 
of the same name), and when you select that item, this style will be used as the 
global style and applied to the current structures. You can use the <b>Remove</b> 
item to remove a style from your list. Your style definitions are saved in a file 
automatically; you can change the location of this file using <b>Change File</b>. 
This also allows you to keep different sets of favorite styles or even share these 
styles with others; when you do <b>Change File</b>, the styles in the current 
<b>Favorites</b> menu are replaced with the those in the file you select. 
<h3><a name="rendering_short"></a>Rendering shortcuts</h3>
These are shortcuts to predefined rendering styles. They will change how structures 
are shaped, but colors will are unaffected. The shortcuts have the same meanings 
as the various <A href="#rendering_descr">rendering styles</A>, but are applied 
to the entire structure rather than to specific groups. <b>Toggle sidechains</b> 
will turn side chains on or off in the current style. 
<h3><a name="coloring_short"></a>Coloring shortcuts</h3>
These are shortcuts to predefined coloring styles. They will change how structures 
are colored, but shapes will be unaffected. The shortcuts have the same meanings 
as the various <A href="#coloring_descr">coloring styles</A>, but are applied 
to the entire structure rather than to specific groups. 
<h3><a name="annotate"></a>Annotate</h3>
<p>This panel allows you to annotate a structure by defining different styles 
  - rendering, coloring, and labeling - to specific sets of residues. This could 
  be used, for example, to emphasize the amino acids that comprise the active 
  site of a protein, in a figure for a publication. </p>
<p>To create a new annotation, simply highlight the residues and molecules you 
  would like to include in the annotation. They can be from any number of different 
  chains or even PDB structures. Then bring up this panel and click on <b>New</b>. 
  You will be prompted for a short name and a longer description, and the <b>edit 
  style</b> button will bring up the standard <A href="#edit">style editor</A> 
  - except that the style for only the highlighted residues is changed.</p>
<p>You can have any number of style annotations defined. The annotations you have 
  created are listed in the <b>Available</b> area. By default, a new annotation 
  is always turned on. The <b>Displayed</b> area shows which annotations are visible; 
  to turn an individual annotation off, simply select it and click on <b>Turn 
  off</b>, and to redisplay it again, select it and click <b>Turn on</b>.</p>
<p>The bottom row of buttons are operations you can do on whichever annotation 
  is currently selected. <b>Highlight</b> will cause the residues and molecules 
  associated with the annotation to become highlighted. <b>Edit</b> allows you 
  to change the annotation's name, description, and style definition. <b>Move</b> 
  can be used to change the location of the annotation - simply highlight the 
  residues and molecules you would like to move the annotation onto, then press 
  this button. <b>Delete</b> will remove the annotation completely.</p>
<p>If annotations cover overlapping regions of residues, then the style associated 
  with the annotation at the top of the <b>Displayed</b> list is the one that 
  is shown in the overlapping area. If you would like instead for another overlapped 
  style to be displayed, select that annotation and press <b>Move up</b> until 
  that style is at the top of the <b>Displayed</b> list. Similarly, you can lower 
  the annotation's order by pressing <b>Move down</b>.</p>
