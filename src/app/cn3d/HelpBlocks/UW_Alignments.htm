<h3><a name="merge_single"></a>Merge single</h3>
Select this item and then click on an import sequence to merge it into the end of the multiple
alignment. Note that the merge will succeed if and only if all blocks of the multiple
alignment are contained in blocks of the import alignment, without insertions.
An unmergeable import will be marked with a red background to indicate where the
alignment is incompatible.
<h3><a name="merge_neighbor"></a>Merge to neighbor</h3>
Similar to <a href="#merge_single">merge single</a> except that the sequence is positioned in the multiple alignment
right after its closest neighbor (by simple sum of BLOSUM62 scores).
<h3><a name="merge_all"></a>Merge all</h3>
Similar to <a href="#merge_single">merge single</a>, except all imports that are
compatible with the multiple alignment are merged in.
<h3><a name="delete_single"></a>Delete single</h3>
Select this item and then click on an import to delete it.
<h3><a name="delete_all"></a>Delete all</h3>
Removes all import alignments from the window.
