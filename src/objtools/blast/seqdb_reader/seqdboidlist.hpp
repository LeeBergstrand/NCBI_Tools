/// This class defines a set of included oids over the entire oid
/// range.  The underlying implementation is a large bit map.  If the
/// database has one volume, which uses an OID mask file, this object
/// will memory map that file and use it directly.  Otherwise, an area
/// of memory will be allocated (one bit per OID), and the relevant
/// bits will be turned on in that space.  This information may come
/// from memory mapped oid lists, or it may come from GI lists, which
/// are converted to OIDs using ISAM indices.  Because of these two
/// modes of operation, care must be taken to insure that the
/// placement of the bits exactly corresponds to the layout of the
/// memory mappable oid mask files.
