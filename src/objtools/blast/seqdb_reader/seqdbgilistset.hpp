    ///
    /// This class encapsulates some of the behavior of the GI lists
    /// owned by the SeqDB object.  First, GI lists read from files
    /// will be shared by any number of volumes.  Secondly, the
    /// constructor takes a user GI list, which has a special effect
    /// when translating GIs.  If it is not specified, all alias node
    /// GI lists will be completely translated via the ISAM indices.
    /// If it is specified, then alias node GI lists will only be
    /// translated from the user GI list, so that only those GIs
    /// mentioned in the user GI list will be available (but the
    /// translation should be faster).
    ///

    ///   The memory management layer object.

    /// list.  If the user GI list is not available, the ISAM database
    /// will be consulted to translate this GI list on every call to
    /// this method.  This is necessary because each volume can supply
