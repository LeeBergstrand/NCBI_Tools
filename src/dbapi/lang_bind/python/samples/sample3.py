# Description: a NCBI DBAPI Python extension module usage example.
# (using SQL parameters)
#
# ===========================================================================

# 1) Import NCBI DBAPI Python extension module
import python_ncbi_dbapi

# 2) Connect to a database
# Parameters: connect(driver_name, db_type, server_name, db_name, user_name, user_pswd, use_std_interface)
# driver_name: ctlib, dblib, ftds, odbc, mysql
# db_type (case insensitive): SYBASE, MSSQL, MYSQL
# server_name: database server name
# db_name: default database name
# use_std_interface: an optional parameter (default value is "False")
conn = python_ncbi_dbapi.connect('ftds', 'MSSQL', 'MS_DEV1', 'DBAPI_Sample', 'anyone', 'allowed')

# 3) Allocate a cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# 4) Execute a SQL statement with a parameter.
# Parameter values should be passed as a mapping.
cursor.execute('select name, type from sysobjects where type = @type_par', {'@type_par':'S'})

# 5) Fetch all records using 'fetchall()'
print "Fetch all records using 'fetchall()'"
print cursor.fetchall()
