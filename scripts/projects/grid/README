This package contains miscellaneous client-side Grid applications.

Here is a brief description of the containing applications:

* remote_app

    A worker node daemon capable of running multiple distributed
    copies of regular applications and collecting their output in the
    Grid for later retrieval by what is called the submitter.

* remote_cgi

    A worker node daemon that runs CGI applications in the simulated
    environment of a web server. The concept is similar to what
    remote_app does except that the submitter is always an instance
    of the cgi2rcgi application.

* cgi2rcgi

    CGI application that serializes HTTP requests and sends them
    over the Grid for processing by remote_cgi worker nodes.

* cgi_tunnel2grid.cgi

    This is the early days version of the cgi2rcgi application.
    Please do not use it.

* grid_mgr.cgi

    This is a CGI application that displays status of Grid services.
    It is installed and can be accessed at
    http://intranet/ieb/ToolBox/STAT/grid_monitor/grid_mgr.cgi

* ns_submit_remote_job

    Utility for submitting jobs for later processing by remote_app.
    Command line arguments of the remote application can be specified
    on the command line of ns_submit_remote_job and remote application
    output can be retrieved later with ns_remote_job_control.

* ns_remote_job_control

    This utility is for querying information about a NetSchedule job.
    It also can be used to stop worker nodes and cancel jobs.

* test_gridclient_stress

    An integrated stress test for Grid. It submits and then waits for
    the specified number of NetSchedule jobs.  It is also possible to
    specify the amount of data transmitted through NetCache.
