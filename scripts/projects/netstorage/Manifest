#          It is used by release configurator.
#

# The APP: statement describes binaries
# The LIB: statement describes libraries
# The DLL: statement describes shared objects
# The ETC: statement describes configuration files
# It is allowed to have more than one of each statements
APP: netstoraged
ETC: src/app/netstorage/netstoraged.ini

DEFAULT_CONFIGURATIONS: Linux64-Centos:Release

# Each line describes a single configuration
# The format is as follows:
# <HardwareIdentifier> : <ReleaseSuffix> : <CompilerConfigurationScriptWithKeys>
# Configuration script is relative to c++/compilers/unix/ .
# Release configurator assumes that this script will eventually call standard configure script and pass all options
# to it. So some standard options may be added by release configurator, such as --build-root-sfx, --with-projects,
# --with-distcc, --with-action etc.
