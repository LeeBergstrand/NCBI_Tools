XmlWrapp 2.1.0 is a fork of the xmlwrapp-0.6.0 library from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlwrapp/, but has a separate versioning
schema that started at 2.0.0.  XmlWrapp revises xmlwrapp's original API
specifically to meet the needs of in-house NCBI developers, breaking
compatibility with the original version.


The main features of both versions include:
- Tree parser (DOM)
- Event parser (SAX)
- Creation / removal of nodes, attributes and documents
- Searching nodes and attributes
- XSLT transformation support
- DTD validation support
- XML catalog support

In addition, XmlWrapp enhances xmlwrapp with:
- XPath support
- Full-featured XML namespace support for both nodes and attributes
- XSD validation support
- Extended functionality of manipulating with default attributes
- Safer iterator dereferencing
- Extended error collection on parsing documents


The XmlWrapp package has been tested on at least the following platforms:
- Linux CentOS with GCC and ICC
- Cygwin with GCC
- SunOS on x86 with GCC and Sun WorkShop
- SunOS on Sparc with GCC and Sun WorkShop
- MAC on x86 with GCC and XCode
- Windows with Visual Studio 2010
- FreeBSD with GCC
- Ubuntu with GCC
- Fedora with GCC
