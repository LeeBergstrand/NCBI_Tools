// The BLAST Engine currently needs the BlastRPSInfo structure for both the
// preliminary stage and the traceback search. In practice, the setup code
// needs the aux_info field to copy the orig_score_matrix field, gap costs and
// scaling factor. The preliminary stage needs its lookup_header and 
// profile_header fields, and the traceback search needs the profile_header
// field and the aux_info's karlin_k field. This suggests that a better
// organization might be needed.
