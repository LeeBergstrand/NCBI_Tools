///
/// CAlignFilter exposes a query language for inspecting properties and scores
/// placed on Seq-align objects.  The query language supports a wide variety of
/// parameters and language structures.
///
/// Basic syntax
/// ------------
///
///  - Queries can contain any mix of balanced parentheses
///  - Queries can use standard boolean operators (AND / OR / NOT; operators
///    are not case sensitive)
///  - Queries consist of tokens expressing a conditional phrase, of the forms:
///      -# a = b
///      -# a != b
///      -# a < b
///      -# a > b
///  - Tokens may be a numeric or a text string.  Text strings are evaluated in
///    a dictionary against a list of known computable values.  If a text
///    string is not found in the computed dictionary, the text string is
///    looked up as a score in Seq-align.score.
///  - CAlignFilter supports a set of functions as well.  Functions express
///    additional parameters or mathematical operations.  The current list of
///    functions is:
///     -# MUL(a, b) = a * b; a and b are tokens as defined above
///     -# ADD(a, b) = a + b; a and b are tokens as defined above
///     -# IS_SEG_TYPE(a) = 1 if the Seq-align is of segment type a (where a is
///       one of 'disc', 'denseg', 'std', 'spliced', 'packed', 'dendiag')
///     -# COALESCE(a,b,...) = first of (a, b, ...) that evaluates to a
///       supported value.  In order to avoid problems when querying against a
///       missing value, COALESCE() allows the specification of alternate score
///       names or of alternate values.  Thus, COALESCE(score, 0) will return 0
///       if 'score' is not present.
///
/// Current Accepted Tokens
/// -----------------------
///
/// - Any named score.  CSeq_align enforces through the use of enums specific
///   score names; some standard score names are described in CSeq_align and
///   include:
///     -# align_length
///     -# bit_score
///     -# comp_adjustment_method
///     -# e_value
///     -# longest_gap
///     -# num_ident
///     -# num_mismatch
///     -# num_negatives
///     -# num_positives
///     -# pct_coverage
///     -# pct_identity_gap
///     -# pct_identity_gapopen_only
///     -# pct_identity_ungap
///     -# score
///     -# sum_e
///   NOTE: There is no requirement that an alignment contain any of the above
///   scores.
///
/// - Any number.  All numbers are interpreted as doubles.
///
/// - One of a fixed set of computable characteristics locally defined in
///   CAlignFilter.  These include:
///     -# 3prime_unaligned - Length of 3' unaligned sequence
///     -# 5prime_unaligned - Length of 5' unaligned sequence (same as
///       query_start)
///     -# align_length - Length of aligned query span
///     -# align_length_ratio - Length of aligned subject span / length of
///       aligned query span
///     -# align_length_ungap - Sum of lengths of aligned query segments
///     -# cds_internal_stops - For Spliced-segs, returns the count of the
///       number of internal stops present in the mapped CDS (mapped =
///       CGeneModel::CreateGeneModel() mapped)
///     -# internal_unaligned - Length of unaligned sequence between 5'-most and
///       3'-most ends
///     -# min_exon_len - Length of shortest exon
///     -# product_length - Same as query_length
///     -# query_end - End pos (0-based) of query sequence
///     -# query_length - Length of query sequence
///     -# query_start - Start pos (0-based) of query sequence
///     -# subject_end - Ending pos (0-based) of subject span
///     -# subject_length - Length of subject length
///     -# subject_start - Starting pos (0-based) of subject span
///
/// - A specific sequence identifier.  The special tokens 'query' and 'subject'
///   can be used to specify individual sequences using any of the sequence's
///   seq-id synonyms
///
///
/// Example queries:
/// ----------------
///
/// - pct_coverage > 99.5
///     - finds alignments with the score pct_coverage > 99.5
///
/// - (pct_identity_gap > 99.9 AND pct_coverage > 98) OR (pct_identity_gap > 99.0 AND pct_coverage > 99.5)
///     - Evaluates two simultaneous logical conditions, returning the
///       inclusive OR set
///
/// - query = NM_012345.1
///     - returns all alignments for the query sequence
///
/// - MUL(align_length, 0.8) > num_positives
///     - evaluates for all alignments for which num_positives covers 80% of
///      the aligned length
///
