/// Note about the "buf_size" parameter for streams in this API.
///
/// CRWStream implementation is targeted at minimizing in-memory data
/// copy operations associated with I/O for intermediate buffering.
/// For that, the following policies apply:
///
/// 1.  No read operation from the input device shall request less than the
///     internal stream buffer size.  In cases when the user code requests more
///     than the internal stream buffer size, the request may be passed through
///     to the input device to read directly into the buffer provided by user.
///     In that case, the read request can only be larger than the the size of
///     the internal stream buffer.
///
/// 2.  Write operations to the output device are done in full buffers, unless:
///  a. An incoming user write request is larger than the internal buffer,
///     then the contents of the internal buffer gets flushed first (which may
///     comprise of fewer than the intrernal buffer size bytes) followed by
///     the direct write request of the user's block (larger than the internal
///     stream buffer);
///  b. Flushing of an internal buffer (including 2a above) resulted in a short
///     write to the device (fewer bytes actually written), then the successive
///     write attempt may contain fewer bytes than the size of the internal
///     stream buffer (namely, the remainder of what has been left behind by
///     the preceding write attempt).  This case also applies when the flushing
///     has been done internally in a tied stream prior to reading.
///
/// However, any portable implementation should *not* rely on how data chunks
/// are being flushed or requested by the stream implementations.  If further
/// factoring into blocks (e.g. specially-sized) is necessary for the I/O
/// device to operate correctly, that should be implemented at the level of
/// respective IReader/IWriter API explicitly.
