struct NCBI_XNCBI_EXPORT CStreamUtils
{
// Push the block of data [buf, buf+buf_size) back to the input stream "is".
// If "del_ptr" is not NULL, then `delete[] (CT_CHAR_TYPE*) del_ptr' is called
// some time between the moment you call this function (perhaps, prior to when
// it returns) and when the passed block is no longer needed (i.e. its content
// is stored elsewhere, or its all read out from the stream, or if the stream
// is destructed).  Since this function may, at its own discretion, use the
// passed "buf" directly in the input stream as long as it needs to, for the
// sake of data integrity and consistency the block should not be modified
// from the outside until all of the passed data is read out from the stream.
// NOTE 1:  It's okay to pushback arbitrary data (i.e. not necessarily
//          just what has been last read from the stream).
// NOTE 2:  Data does not actually go to the original streambuf of "is".
// NOTE 3:  It's okay if "is" is a full-duplex stream (iostream).
// NOTE 4:  Data pushed back regardless of the current stream state, so it is
//          the caller's responsibility to check and possibly clear stream
//          state that can prevent further reading (e.g. an EOF condition
//          reached previously).
// NOTE 5:  After a pushback, the stream is allowed to do limited seeks
//          relative to current position (ios::cur);  only direct-access
//          (ios::beg, ios::end) seeks are fully okay (if permitted by "is").
// NOTE 6:  Stream re-positioning made after pushback clears all pushback data.
// NOTE 7:  The standard specifically says that putbacks must be interleaved
//          with reads in order to work properly.  That is especially
//          important to keep in mind, when using both the standard
//          putbacks and the pushbacks offered by this API.
// NOTE 8:  Implementation is incomplete (but safe and stable) and may leak
//          memory in Solaris WorkShop MT builds (due to a bug in C++ RTL).
