NCBI BDB library is a C++ library on top of Berkeley DB C API v 4.1.xx.
It works with b-tree based Berkeley DB files.

NCBI BDB library implements several key features:
  - integration with NCBI C++ Toolkit, error handling and diagnistics
  - object oriented wrapper on top of Berkeley DB
  - extendable set of basic scalar datatypes
  - improved record management

 Berkeley DB is a compact small footprint embedded data management system.
 It does not provide any database specific query language, instead it has a
 C language API to manipulate directly on database records, create cursors for
 key based or sequential data access.

 Berkeley DB is an open source product developed and supported by 
 Sleepycat Software (www.sleepycat.com).
