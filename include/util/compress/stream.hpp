// CCompression based stream classes
//
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// All CCompression based streams uses a "stream processors" that works as
// adapters between current stream's I/O interface and a some other stream,
// specified in the constructor. Any stream processor can implement either
// compression or decompression.

// On reading from stream, data will be read from the underlying stream,
// processed by "read stream processor", and next processed data will be
// carried to called process.
// Also, all data written into CCompression[IO]Stream stream will be processed
// using "write stream processor" and further written into underlying stream. 
// 
// Note:
//   Notice that generally the input/output stream you pass to
//   CCompression[IO]Stream class constructor must be in binary mode, because
//   the compressed data always is binary (decompressed data also can be
//   binary) and the conversions which happen in text mode will corrupt it.
//
// Note:
//   CCompression[IO]Stream class objects must be finalized after use.
//   At least one IO operation should be accomplished before finalization.
//   Only after finalization all data put into stream will be processed
//   for sure. By default finalization called in the class destructor, however
//   it can be done in any time by call Finalize(). After finalization you
//   can only read from the stream (if it is derived from istream).
//   If you don't read that some data can be lost. 
//
// Note:
//   The compression streams don't write nothing into output, if no input data
//   is provided. This can be especially important for cases where output data 
//   should have any header/footer (like .gz files for example). So, for empty
//   input, you will have empty output, that may not be acceptable to external
//   tools like gunzip and etc.
//
// Note:
//   There is one special aspect of CCompression[I]OStream class. Basically
//   the compression algorithms works on blocks of data. They waits until
//   a block is full and then compresses it. As long as you only feed data
//   to the stream without flushing it this works normally. If you flush
//   the stream, you force a premature end of the data block. This will cause
//   a worse compression factor. You should avoid flushing an output buffer
//   to get a better compression ratio.
//
//   Accordingly, the using input stream with compression usually have worse
//   compression than output stream with compression. Because a stream needs
//   to flush data from compressor very often. Increasing compressor buffer
//   size can to amend this situation.
//
