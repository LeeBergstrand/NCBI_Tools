 *   Assumptions on the fields: all fields in the server info come in
 *   host byte order except 'host', which comes in network byte order.

/* Server specification consists of the following:
 * TYPE [host][:port] [server-specific_parameters] [tags]
 *
 * TYPE := { STANDALONE | NCBID | HTTP[{_GET|_POST}] | FIREWALL | DNS }
 *
 * Host should be specified as either an IP address (in dotted notation),
 * or as a host name (using domain notation if necessary).
 * Port number must be preceded by a colon.
 * Both host and port get their default values if not specified.
 *
 * Server-specific parameters:
 *
 *    Standalone servers: None
 *                        Servers of this type do not take any arguments.
 *
 *    NCBID servers: Arguments to CGI in addition to specified by application.
 *                   Empty additional arguments denoted as '' (two single
 *                   quotes, back to back).  Note that the additional
 *                   arguments must not contain space characters.
 *
 *    HTTP* servers: Path (required) and args (optional) in the form
 *                   path[?args] (here brackets denote the optional part).
 *                   Note that no spaces are allowed within these parameters.
 *
 *    FIREWALL servers: Servers of this type are converted real servers of
 *                      the above types, when only accessible via FIREWALL
 *                      mode of NCBI dispatcher.  The purpose of this fake
 *                      server type is just to let the client know that
 *                      the service exists.  Additional parameter is optional
 *                      and if present, is the original type of the server
 *                      before conversion.  Note that servers of this type
 *                      cannot be configured in LBSMD.
 *
 *    DNS servers: Services for DNS and DB load-balancing, 
 *                 and dynamic ProxyPassing at the NCBI Web entry point.
 *                 Never exported to the outside world.
 *
 * Tags may follow in no particular order but no more than one instance
 * of each flag is allowed:
 *
 *    Load average calculation for the server:
 *       Regular        (default)
 *       Blast
 *
 *    Bonus coefficient:
 *       B=double       [0.0 = default]
 *           specifies a multiplicative bonus given to a server run locally,
 *           when calculating reachability rate.
 *           Special rules apply to negative/zero values:
 *           0.0 means not to use the described rate increase at all (default
 *           rate calculation is used, which only slightly increases rates
 *           of locally run servers).
 *           Negative value denotes that locally run server should
 *           be taken in first place, regardless of its rate, if that rate
 *           is larger than percent of expressed by the absolute value
 *           of this coefficient of the average rate coefficient of other
 *           servers for the same service.  That is, -5 instructs to
 *           ignore locally run server if its status is less than 5% of
 *           average status of remaining servers for the same service.
 *
 *    Content type indication:
 *       C=type/subtype [no default]
 *           specification of Content-Type (including encoding), which server
 *           accepts. The value of this flag gets added automatically to any
 *           HTTP packet sent to the server by SERVICE connector. However, in
 *           order to communicate, a client still has to know and generate the
 *           data type accepted by the server, i.e. a protocol, which server
 *           understands.  This flag just helps ensure that all HTTP packets
 *           get proper content type, defined at service configuration.
 *           This tag is not allowed in DNS server specifications.
 *
 *    Local server:
 *       L=no           (default for non-DNS specs)
 *       L=yes          (default for DNS specs)
 *           Local servers are accessible only by local clients (from within
 *           the Intranet) or direct clients of LBSMD, and are not accessible
 *           by the outside users (i.e. via network dispatching).
 *
 *    Private server:
 *       P=no           (default)
 *       P=yes
 *           specifies whether the server is private for the host.
 *           Private server cannot be used from anywhere else but
 *           this host.  When non-private (default), the server lacks
 *           'P=no' in verbal representation resulted from SERV_WriteInfo().
 *           This tag is not allowed in DNS server specifications.
 *
 *    Quorum:
 *       Q=integer      [0 = default]
 *           specifies how many dynamic service entries have to be defined
 *           by respective hosts in order for this entry to be INACTIVE.
 *           Note that value 0 disables the quorum and the entry becomes
 *           effective immediately.  The quorum flag is to create a standby
 *           configuration, which is to be activated in case of either server
 *           or network malfunction.  Use of this flag is not encouraged.
 *           Only static and non-FIREWALL server specs can have this tag.
 *
 *    Reachability base rate:
 *       R=double       [0.0 = default]
 *           specifies availability rate for the server, expressed as
 *           a floating point number with 0.0 meaning the server is down
 *           (unavailable) and 1000.0 meaning the server is up and running.
 *           Intermediate or higher values can be used to make the server less
 *           or more favorable for choosing by LBSM Daemon, as this coefficient
 *           is directly used as a multiplier in the load-average calculation
 *           for the entire family of servers for the same service.
 *           (If equal to 0.0 then defaulted by the LBSM Daemon to 1000.0.)
 *           Normally, LBSMD keeps track of server reachability, and
 *           dynamically switches this rate to be the maximal specified when
 *           the server is up, and to be zero when the server is down.
 *           Note that negative values are reserved for LBSMD private use.
 *           To specify a server as inactive in LBSMD configuration file,
 *           one can use any negative number (note that value "0" in the config
 *           file means "default" and gets replaced with the value 1000.0).
 *           Values less than 0.01 define standby server entries, which are
 *           used by the clients only if there are no working entries with a
 *           higher initial rate available (the final rate, which takes load
 *           into account can make it smaller than 0.01 for such entries).
 *           Standby entries are not governed by the host load but the values
 *           of rates in the descending order (for same-rate entries, an entry
 *           is taken at random).
 *
 *    Stateful server:
 *       S=no           (default)
 *       S=yes
 *           Indication of stateful server, which allows only dedicated socket
 *           (stateful) connections.
 *           This tag is not allowed for HTTP* and DNS servers.
 *
 *    Validity period:
 *       T=integer      [0 = default]
 *           specifies the time in seconds this server entry is valid
 *           without update. (If equal to 0 then defaulted by
 *           the LBSM Daemon to some reasonable value.)
 *
 *
 * Note that optional arguments can be omitted along with all preceding
 * optional arguments, that is the following 2 server specifications are
 * both valid:
 *
 * NCBID ''
 * and
 * NCBID
 *
 * but they are not equal to the following specification:
 *
 * NCBID Regular
 *
 * because here 'Regular' is treated as an argument, not as a tag.
 * To make the latter specification equivalent to the former two, one has
 * to use the following form:
 *
 * NCBID '' Regular
