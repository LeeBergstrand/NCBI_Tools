 *   and handle connection("CONN", see also in "ncbi_connection.[ch]") to an
 *   abstract I/O service. This is generally not for the public use.
 *   It is to be used in the modules that implement a particular connector.

 * the same as those for their counterparts "CONN_***" in ncbi_connection.h.
 * First argument of these functions accepts a real connector handle rather
 * than an upper-level connection handle("CONN").
 * In every call that takes STimeout as an argument, the argument can be either
 * NULL (for infinite timeout, kInfiniteTimeout) or a valid non-NULL pointer
 * that points to a finite timeout structure.  Note that kDefaultTimeout gets
 * resolved at the level of the connection and does not get passed through.
