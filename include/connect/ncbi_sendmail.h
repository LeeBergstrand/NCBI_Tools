 * @return
 *  Return value equals the argument "info" passed in.
 * @note It is allowed to pre-fill "info->host" (of the "info" being inited)
 *       with one of the above patterns, and pass it as the "from" parameter.
 * @note Unlike the username part of the return address, the hostname part is
 *       never truncated but dropped altogether if it does not fit.
 * @note If the username is unobtainable, then it is be replaced with the word
 *       "anonymous".
