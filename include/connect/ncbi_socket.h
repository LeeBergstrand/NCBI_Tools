 *                       Multi-Thread safety NOTICE
 *
 * If you are using this API in a multi-threaded application, and there is
 * more than one thread using this API, it is safe to call SOCK_InitializeAPI()
 * explicitly at the beginning of your main thread, before you run any other
 * threads, and to call SOCK_ShutdownAPI() after all threads have exited.
 *
 * As soon as the API is initialized it becomes relatively MT-safe, however
 * you still must not operate on same LSOCK or SOCK objects from different
 * threads simultaneously.  Any entry point of this API will attempt to
 * initialize the API implicitly if that has not yet been previously done.
 * However, the implicit initialization gets disabled by SOCK_ShutdownAPI()
 * (explicit re-init with SOCK_InitializeAPI() is always allowed).
 *
 * A MUCH BETTER WAY of dealing with this issue is to provide your own MT
 * locking callback (see CORE_SetLOCK() in "ncbi_core.h").  This will also
 * ensure proper MT protection should some SOCK functions start accessing
 * any intrinsic static data (such as in case of SSL).
 *
 * The MT lock as well as other library-wide settings are also provided
 * (in most cases automatically) by CONNECT_Init() API:  for C Toolkit it gets
 * always called before [Nlm_]Main();  in C++ Toolkit it gets called by
 * most of C++ classes' ctors, except for sockets;  so if your application
 * does not use any C++ classes besides sockets, it has to set CORE_LOCK
 * explicitly, as described above.

 * eIO_ReadPeek    -- same as "eIO_ReadPlain" but do not extract the data from
 *                    the socket (so that the next read operation will see the
 *                    data again), with one important exception noted below.
 * eIO_ReadPersist -- read exactly "size" bytes and return eIO_Success; if less
 *                    data received then return an error condition (including
 *                    eIO_Timeout).
 *
 * If there is no data available to read (also, if eIO_ReadPersist and cannot
 * read exactly "size" bytes) and the timeout(see SOCK_SetTimeout()) is expired
 * then return eIO_Timeout.
 *
 * Both eIO_ReadPlain and eIO_ReadPeek return eIO_Success iff some data have
 * been read (perhaps within the time allowance specified by eIO_Read timeout).
 * Both mothods return any other code when no data at all were available.
 * eIO_ReadPersist differs from the other two methods as it can return an
 * error condition even if some data were actually obtained from the socket.
 * Hence, as the *rule of thumb*, an application should always check the number
 * of read bytes BEFORE checking the return status, which merely advises
 * whether it is okay to read again.
 *
 * As a special case, "buf" may passed as NULL:
 *   eIO_ReadPeek      -- read up to "size" bytes and store them
 *                        in internal buffer;
 *   eIO_Read[Persist] -- discard up to "size" bytes from internal buffer
 *                        and socket (check "*n_read" to know how many).
 *
 * @note  "Read" and "peek" methods differ:  if "read" is
 *        performed and not enough but only some data available immediately
 *        from the internal buffer, then the call still completes with
 *        eIO_Success status.  For "peek", if not all requested data were
 *        available, the real I/O occurs to pick up additional data (if any)
 *        from the system.  Keep this difference in mind when programming
 *        loops that heavily use "peek"s without "read"s.
 * @note  If on input "size" == 0, then "*n_read" is set to 0,

/******************************************************************************
 *  DATAGRAM SOCKETS (connectionless)
 *
 *  How the datagram exchange API works:
 *
 *  Datagram socket is created with special DSOCK_Create[Ex]() calls but the
 *  resulting object is a SOCK handle.  That is, almost all SOCK routines
 *  may be applied to the handle.  There are few exceptions, though.
 *  In datagram sockets I/O differs from how it is done in stream sockets:
 *
 *  SOCK_Write() writes data into an internal message buffer, appending new
 *  data as they come with each SOCK_Write().  When the message is complete,
 *  SOCK_SendMsg() should be called (optionally with additional last,
 *  or the only [if no SOCK_Write() preceded the call] message fragment)
 *  to actually send the message down the wire.  If successful, SOCK_SendMsg()
 *  cleans the internal buffer, and the process may repeat.  If unsuccessful,
 *  SOCK_SendMsg() can be repeated with restiction that no additional data are
 *  provided in the call.  This way, the entire message will be attempted to
 *  be sent again.  On the other hand, if after any SOCK_SendMsg() new data
 *  are added [regardless of whether previous data were successfully sent
 *  or not], all previously written [and kept in the internal send buffer]
 *  data get dropped and replaced with the new data.
 *
 *  DSOCK_WaitMsg() can be used to learn whether there is a new message
 *  available for read by DSOCK_RecvMsg() immediately.
 *
 *  SOCK_RecvMsg() receives the message into an internal receive buffer,
 *  and optionally can return the initial datagram fragment via provided
 *  buffer [this initial fragment is then stripped from what remains unread
 *  in the internal buffer].  Optimized version can supply a maximal message
 *  size (if known in advance), or 0 to get a message of any allowed size.
 *  The actual size of the received message can be obtained via a
 *  pointer-type argument 'msgsize'.  The message kept in the internal buffer
 *  can be read out in several SOCK_Read() calls, last returning eIO_Closed,
 *  when all data have been taken out.  SOCK_Wait() returns eIO_Success while
 *  there are data in the internal message buffer that SOCK_Read() can read.
 *
 *  SOCK_WipeMsg() can be used to clear the internal message buffers in
 *  either eIO_Read or eIO_Write directions, meaning receive and send
 *  buffers correspondingly.
