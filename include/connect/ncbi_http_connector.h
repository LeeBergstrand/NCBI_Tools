/** HTTP connector flags.
 *
 * @var fHTTP_Flushable
 *       by default all data written to the connection are kept until read
 *       begins (even though CONN_Flush() might have been called in between the
 *       writes);  with this flag set, CONN_Flush() will result the data to be
 *       actually sent to the server side, so the following write will form a
 *       new request, and not get added to the previous one;  also this flag
 *       assures that the connector sends at least an HTTP header on "CLOSE"
 *       and re-"CONNECT", even if no data for HTTP body have been written
 *
 * @var fHTTP_KeepHeader
 *       Do not strip HTTP header (i.e. everything up to the first "\r\n\r\n",
 *       including the "\r\n\r\n") from the CGI script's response (including
 *       any server error, which then is made available for reading as well)
 *       *NOTE* this flag disables automatic authorization, redirection, etc.
 *
 * @var fHTTP_UrlDecodeInput
 *       Assume the response body as single-part, URL-encoded;  perform the
 *       URL-decoding on read, and deliver decoded data to the user.
 *
 * @var fHTTP_NoUpread
 *       Do *not* do internal reading into temporary buffer while sending data
 *       to HTTP server;  by default any send operation tries to extract data
 *       as they are coming back from the server in order to prevent stalling
 *       due to data clogging in the connection.
 *
 * @var fHTTP_DropUnread
 *       Do not collect incoming data in "Read" mode before switching into
 *       "Write" mode for preparing next request;  by default all data sent by
 *       the server get stored even if not all of it had been requested prior
 *       to a "Write" following a "Read" was issued (stream emulation).
 *
 * @var fHTTP_NoAutoRetry
 *       Do not attempt any auto-retries in case of failing connections
 *       (this flag effectively means having SConnNetInfo::max_try set to 1).

 * @var fHTTP_InsecureRedirect
 *       For security reasons the following redirects comprise security risk
 *       and, thus, are prohibited:  switching from https to http, and
 *       re-posting data (regardless of the transport, either http or https);
 *       this flag allows such redirects (when encountered) to be honored.
 *
 * @note
 *  URL encoding/decoding (in the "fHTTP_Url*" cases and "net_info->args")
 *  is performed by URL_Encode() and URL_Decode() -- see "ncbi_connutil.[ch]".

 * - FHTTP_Adjust() gets invoked every time before starting a new "HTTP
 *   micro-session" making a hit when a previous hit has failed;  it is passed
 *   "net_info" as stored within the connector, and the number of previously
 *   unsuccessful consecutive attempts since the connection was opened;  a zero
 *   (false) return value ends the retries.
 * - FHTTP_Cleanup() gets called when the connector is about to be destroyed;

/** Create new CONNECTOR structure to hit the specified URL using HTTP with
 * either POST / GET (or ANY) method.  Use the configuration values stored in
 * "net_info".  If "net_info" is NULL, then use the default info as created by
 * ConnNetInfo_Create(0).
 *
 * If "net_info" does not explicitly specify an HTTP request method (i.e. it
 * has it as "eReqMethod_Any"), then the actual method sent to the HTTP server
 * depends on whether any data have been written to the connection with
 * CONN_Write():  the presense of pending data will cause POST request (with a
 * "Content-Length:" tag provided automatically and reflecting the total
 * pending data size), and GET request method will result in the absence of any
 * data.  An explicit value for the request method will cause the specified
 * request to be used regardless of pending data, and will flag an error if any
 * data will have to be sent with a GET (per the standard).
 *
 * In order to workaround some HTTP communication features, this code does:
 *  1. Accumulate all output data in an internal memory buffer until the
 *     first CONN_Read() (including peek) or CONN_Wait(on read) is attempted
 *     (also see fHTTP_Flushable flag below).
 *  2. On the first CONN_Read() or CONN_Wait(on read), compose and send the
 *     whole HTTP request as:
 *        @verbatim
 *        {POST|GET} <net_info->path>?<net_info->args> HTTP/1.0\r\n
 *        <user_header\r\n>
 *        Content-Length: <accumulated_data_length>\r\n
 *        \r\n
 *        <accumulated_data>
 *        @endverbatim
 *     @note
 *       If <user_header> is neither a NULL pointer nor an empty string, then:
 *       - it must NOT contain any "empty lines":  "\r\n\r\n";
 *       - it should be terminated by a single "\r\n";
 *       - it gets inserted to the HTTP header "as is", without any automatic
 *         checking and / or encoding;
 *       - the "user_header" specified in the arguments overrides any user
 *         header that can be provided via the "net_info" argument, see
 *         ConnNetInfo_OverrideUserHeader() from <connect/ncbi_connutil.h>.
 *     @note
 *       Data may depart to the server side earlier if CONN_Flush()'ed in
 *       fHTTP_Flushable connector, see "flags".
 *  3. After the request has been sent, then the response data from the peer
 *     (usually, a CGI program) can be actually read out.
 *  4. On a CONN_Write() operation, which follows data reading, the connection
 *     to the peer is read out until EOF (the data stored internally) then
 *     forcedly closed (the peer CGI process will presumably die if it has not
 *     done so yet on its own), and data to be written again get stored in the
 *     buffer until next "Read" etc, see item 1).  The subsequent read will
 *     first see the leftovers (if any) of data stored previously, then the
 *     new data generated in response to the latest request.  The behavior can
 *     be changed by the fHTTP_DropUnread flag.
 *
 *  @note
 *     If "fHTTP_AutoReconnect" is set in "flags", then the connector makes an
 *     automatic reconnect to the same URL with just the same parameters for
 *     each micro-session steps (1,2,3) repeated.
 *  @note
 *     If "fHTTP_AutoReconnect" is not set then only a single
 *     "Write ... Write Read ... Read" micro-session is allowed, and any
 *     following write attempt fails with "eIO_Closed".
