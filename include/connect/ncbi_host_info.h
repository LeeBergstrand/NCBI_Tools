 * File Description:
 * @file
 *   NCBI host info getters
 *
 *   Host information handle becomes available from SERV_Get[Next]InfoEx()
 *   calls of the service mapper (ncbi_service.c) and remains valid until
 *   destructed by passing into free(). All API functions declared below
 *   accept NULL as 'host_info' parameter, and as the result return a failure
 *   status as described individually for each API call.
